# Huion-Kamvas-22-plus-color-profiles-

various color profiles created with an xrite. (they all look the same though lol)


i suggest you load your color profiles with 

https://github.com/ledoge/novideo_srgb for nvidia cards 

https://github.com/dantmnf/AMDColorTweaks for amd cards 


or

https://github.com/ledoge/dwm_lut for intel , nvidia and amd 


as these are the only known tools (to me) which can apply color correction to the whole desktop including EVERY program.
